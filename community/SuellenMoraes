Suellen Silveira Moraes

Dedicated nanotechnology specialist with a proven track record in developing cutting-edge research into practical solutions for industry. My expertise lies in the synthesis and characterization of nanostructures, nanoporous alumina, and nanowire electrodeposition, coupled with a keen focus on driving innovation in cancer treatment applications.
In my role as a Nanotechnology Researcher at University of Porto, I spearheaded projects that showcased my proficiency in nanowire electrodeposition, utilizing methods such as mild anodization, hard anodization, DC electrodeposition, pulsed electrodeposition, and multisegmented electrodeposition.
A highlight of my contributions includes the strategic encapsulation of magnetic nanowires, leading to the creation of magnetic lipid nanoparticles (MLNP). This breakthrough holds immense promise for industrial applications, particularly in the field of targeted drug delivery for cancer treatment. My hands-on experience in liposome synthesis and optimization of doxorubicin-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers further underscores my commitment to developing practical solutions.
Armed with a PhD in Nanotechnology from University of Porto, I am now eager to apply my expertise and innovative mindset to industry challenges. My goal is to drive advancements that not only align with current industry needs but also anticipate and shape future trends
